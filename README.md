## Project description:
Main objective of this project was to implement different sensors to the sown areas to get data that how is the humidity, temprature, pH value of the soil. It would help us to determine is this product (vegetables, fruits and so on.) either organic or not. Also we have created e-commerce website for farmers to sell their products in this platform and for customers to buy products online. Customers see about soil in the page of product as a table format:

As it is seen for the image, there are different colors in map and percentages. Due to it is the prototype we have only used humidity sensor to get data form hardware and display it on app. The percantages indicate humidity. If humidity is beteen 0 and 50, the color will be red and its shades. Ãœhen humidity is more than 50 the color will be blue and its shades.
